# Webpack Starter

Basic [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) project starter, including directory scaffolding and configuration.

## Library Support

There are currently four example branches, including the `master` branch, configured to use popular approaches to front end development.

- `master`: [vanilla DOM API](https://github.com/earthtone/webpack-demo/tree/master)
- `lit-html`: [lit-html library](https://github.com/earthtone/webpack-demo/tree/lit-html)
- `react`: [react framework](https://github.com/earthtone/webpack-demo/tree/react)
- `vue`: [vue framework](https://github.com/earthtone/webpack-demo/tree/vue)

These examples are not designed to be comprehensive for production ready web applications. They are designed to provide a bare-bones starting point so that developers can better understand/reference the key concepts that popular scaffolding tools use under the hood. It is recommended that developers regularly refer the [official Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). Hopefully, the configuration/setup provided here is basic enough to help build an intution about [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
